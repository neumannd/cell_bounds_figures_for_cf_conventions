.Order of **`lonbnd(i,0)`** and **`lonbnd(i,1)`** as well as of **`latbnd(i,0)`** and **`latbnd(i,1)`** in the case of one-dimensional horizontal coordinate axes. Tuples **`(lon(i,j),lat(i,j))`** represent grid cell centers. The four grid cell vertices are given by **`(lonbnd(i,j,0),latbnd(i,j,0))`**, **`(lonbnd(i,j,1),latbnd(i,j,0))`**, **`(lonbnd(i,j,1),latbnd(i,j,1))`** and **`(lonbnd(i,j,0),latbnd(i,j,1))`**.
